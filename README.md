<h1>Title of the project</h1>
<p>Molecular Geometry Optimisation Using Machine Learning</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
This program is for chemists and physicists who want to estimate and view the structures of
molecules without spending hours doing calculations or using a supercomputer. Geopt is a
program which uses machine learning to predict the shapes of theoretical molecules.</p>

<h2>Supervisor</h2>
<p>Dr. David Walker</p>
